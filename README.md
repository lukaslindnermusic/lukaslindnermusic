## Hi there 👋 I'm Lukas.

Most of the time, I'm composing film scores 🎬 🎵 ✍🏻 <br>
If you are interested in that, you can listen to my [demo reel](https://www.lukaslindner.music/demoreel) or [film-genre-specific samples of my work](https://www.lukaslindner.music/filmgenres).<br>
(If you're short on time, I have a button on my [website](https://www.lukaslindner.music) that plays a random ~5-sec audio snippet each time you click it. 😊)

As a hobby, I also enjoy web development — mostly working on my own filmscoring portfolio website and a custom cloud project for sharing project-related files with clients.
I typically code in PHP and JavaScript (and of course HTML/CSS).

In recent years, I've gotten into self-hosting various services. I've always liked collecting and curating my own media library.
That's also why I recently picked up Dart/Flutter to contribute to **Finamp**, a music player client made for **Jellyfin**.

If you've got filmscoring-related questions - or anything else - feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:get-in-touch@lukaslindner.music). 🤗
